i can put code snippets using the \` character like so
`printf("Hello world!")`


## Startup Specs and Pitch
Have you ever wanted to know where to get the absolute best taco in your city? Thats a hard question to answer because everyone has different tastes. I'm sure if you asked 100 people, some would say Taco bell, some may say a taco from a local street cart, or some fancy mexican restaurant. How do we know which one is the best? sure there are food critics and reviews on yelp- but those are too general or too specific. gRateFood.com will be the first site to crowdsource ratings and rankings of food from users in your area. These ratings will use predetermined criteria to allow users to rate different qualities of their food based on their experience. Results and the totals can then be viewed in a number of ways: You can sort by a food type: for example fries, tacos or burgers, or you can sort by restaurant and find which taco is best at Don Joaquin. If you don't find what you are looking for when you go try someplace new you can update the form with your new findings and help the next person to have YOUR question!

### specs
This site will take user input and store that in a database which will through some algorithms show the averages of scores for a specific food, the highest rankings for that food, the highest ranking food at a location, and the locations with the highest average score. The site will have to store this data for future users and allow them to access it at any time. It might require authentication or accounts for people to log in with or maybe syncing with google or other social media to allow ease of sharing. The site will also use google maps to show locations and be able to request user location to show the highest ratings near the user.
